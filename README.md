# PositionAgents
This interactive chart visualizes the key concept from the Gartner research about when to use AI agents versus other automation approaches. Here's what it shows:
Chart Explanation
The Three Zones:

Traditional Automation Zone (gray) - Simple, stable scenarios where workflow automation or RPA are sufficient
AI Agent Sweet Spot (blue) - Moderate complexity scenarios where AI agents provide the most value
Too Complex Zone (red) - High-complexity scenarios that still require human expertise

Key Insights:

X-axis (Complexity): Represents how complex the environment and goals are
Y-axis (Dynamics): Shows how much variability and change the scenario involves
Interactive scenarios: Click any point to see specific details and recommended solutions

The Sweet Spot Concept: AI agents are most valuable when you need more than simple automation but less than perfect reliability. This includes scenarios like:

Network diagnostics with multi-system correlation
Travel booking with multiple constraints
Customer service requiring contextual understanding
Content creation involving research and synthesis

Business Value: The chart helps you avoid two common mistakes:

Over-engineering: Using expensive AI agents for simple tasks that traditional automation handles well
Under-engineering: Trying to use current AI agents for scenarios that still require human judgment and expertise

This visual framework aligns with the Gartner research showing that AI agents have a strategic "sweet spot" where they deliver maximum value - complex enough to need intelligence, but not so complex that current AI technology can't handle them reliably.
